# A* Visualizer

This A* Visualizer is a Java-based tool that allows users to visualize the A* algorithm in action. A* (pronounced "A-star") is a widely used pathfinding algorithm in artificial intelligence and computer science, particularly in applications such as route planning and game development.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Users can interactively input start and target points, obstacles, and run the A* algorithm to find the shortest path.
- **Real-time Updates**: The visualizer updates in real time as the A* algorithm progresses, allowing users to observe the pathfinding process step by step.

## How to Open

1. **Navigate to Source Code**: Locate the source code directory containing the Java files for the visualizer.
2. **Run MainVisualizer.java**: Execute the `MainVisualizer.java` file.
